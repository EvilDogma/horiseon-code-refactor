# Coding Bootcamp Challenge horiseon-code-refactor

## About this Challenge

For this challenge, we were given some sample code and asked to refactor it to conform to more modern standards. We were asked to replace many 'div' elements with semantic elements such as 'header' and 'main', add 'alt' attributes to images to improve accessibility, and to remove redundant information from the CSS.

Here are the exact requirements we were given

## Challenge Requirements

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
